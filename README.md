# Parent Project for SlipStream Clojure(Script) Modules

A parent `project.clj` file to centrally manage repositories and
dependencies for SlipStream Clojure(Script) modules.

## Setup

To build and release this `project.clj` file to
[clojars](https://clojars.org), you must setup your environment
correctly.

First, set the username and password of your clojars account as
environmental variables:

    export CLOJARS_USERNAME=username
    export CLOJARS_PASSWORD=password

These will be used when pushing the artifacts to clojars.  For the
SixSq release account, the username and password are in 1Password.

Non-snapshot releases of artifacts also must be signed with a GPG key
when uploading to clojars.  You must install GPG and then import the
SixSq Release GPG keys.  The public key, private key, and password are
all in 1Password.

# Release

To release this to clojars, just run the command:

    lein release :patch

This will bump the patch version of the artifact.

In general, use the following guidelines when choosing how to change
the version:

 - :patch for changes that are strictly backwards-compatible,
   e.g. adding new dependencies
 - :minor for changes that change the versions of existing
   dependencies or delete dependencies
 - :major for major changes such as changing repository definitions

After releasing a new version on clojars, you should update all of the
parent references in the child `project.clj` files. 

# Troubleshooting

If you run into an error like the following:

    gpg: signing failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device

The problem is the TTY which GPG is trying to use.  Set the
environmental variable:

    export GPG_TTY=$(tty)

This should then allow GPG to prompt for the password for the private
key.
